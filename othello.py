THE GAME OTHELLO. Othello (aka Reversi) is a game played by two players on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns
and a set of pieces that can change color during the game. The pieces (aka stones and tiles) are white on one
side and black on the other side. Players alternate placing pieces of their color on an 8 x 8 board. The Human
(BLACK) moves first vs. Computer (WHITE).

   If a row, column, or diagonal of consecutive pieces (no blanks) all of the same color becomes flanked
(touched on both ends) by two pieces of the opposite color (one of them being the piece just played, then the
pieces in between are turned over and all become pieces of the boundary color. Hence, the original name
"Reversi." In fact, every legal move MUST turn the color of some of the opponent's pieces. Below White makes a
legal move and turns three black pieces into three white pieces.

                    ......W...         ..........         ......W...
                    ..BBBWBW..    -->  .WBBBWBW..    -->  .WWWWWBW..
                    ......W...         ..........         ......W...
                  White to move        White moves         Result

   If one of the three left-most black pieces (B) was replaced by an empty      +----------------------+
cell, White's move would have been illegal, because no black piece would       1|.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .|
have changed color. If a player cannot legally move, he or she must pass       2|.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .|
the move to the opponent. The game ends when neither player can legally        3|.  .  .  =  .  .  .  .|
move. This usually occurs because the board fills up.                          4|.  .  =  W  B  .  .  .|
                                                                               5|.  .  .  B  W  =  .  .|
   Othello has a fixed starting position, but Reversi does not. See            6|.  .  .  .  =  .  .  .|
diagram. Reversi players use a common pool of 64 pieces, but each Othello      7|.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .|
player has his own pile of 32 pieces. If an Othello player plays his final     8|.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .|
piece--his opponent having passed the move on at least one occasion--the        +----------------------+
player with pieces can finish making legal moves anyway he wants. Othello        a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
is copyrighted (1973), Reversi (invented prior to 1886) is not. Otherwise,
the games are identical.

   In the above diagram, it is always Black to make his first move. Since a legal move must bound consecutive
pieces of the opposite color, Black has only four legal moves: c4, d3, e6, and f5. These positions are in-
dicated by equal signs. In fact, these four moves all lead to the same geometric position either mirrored, or
rotated 180 degrees, or both. So Black's first move is already known by his opponent.

Python's Tk graphics:
     1) The command exit() seems to cause errors in Tk graphics.
     2) Tk graphics commands with syntax errors often do NOT stop the program from running. But they
        do print error messages to the console window.
     3) Global variables are REQUIRED in Python's Tk graphics.                     +---------------+
     4) A global variable, say M, cannot be modified unless the word "global"      |  def doit():  |
        appears on the first line of a function. (I made this mistake several      |      global M |
        times in writing this program. Argg!) After the word global the list       +---------------+
        of global variables must follow. See the example on the right.

ASSIGNMENT: Given this working game of Othello (human (black) vs. computer (white)), write a better strategy.
            But first ...

            1. We want the program to display black's legal moves with the number of white pieces that would
               be turned over if black (the human) chooses any candidate move. In fact the code to do this
               exists in the program. It has just been turned off. Turn it back on.
            2. The numbers displayed to help black choose his move are 'BLACK' and of a small font height.
               Make them 'GOLD' and three times as large.
            3. The program should print the current number of white tiles and black tiles, but somehow the
               scores are always the same. Fix this.
            4. Take a look at the computer's strategy. One way to make it considerably stronger is to have it
               choose a corner whenever one is available. Make this change.
            5. The computer uses the greedy strategy. This is usually a pretty good strategy, although rarely
               an optimal strategy. Another reason it is popular is that it is conceptually easy to under-
               stand and then code. Since we are beginners, we will settle for all the experience we can get
               with this simple strategy. The problem is that the computer is just too simple-minded. It just

               looks for the cell that turns over the most of the opponent's pieces (1-ply depth). Instead,
               we should make it 2-ply depth. For each of the computer's legal moves, it should calculate the
               number of pieces turned over MINUS the number of pieces turned back by the human's best reply.
               In fact, somewhere in this program is a function called bestHumanResponse() based on the simple
               greedy strategy that the computer currently uses. Your job is to change the computer's current
               strategy from 1-ply to 2-ply, using the current bestHumanResponse() function.
            6. Change the bestHumanResponse() function to a 2-ply search. Wait! See the next task.
            7. Notice that the initial bestHumanResponse(), and the initial makeComputerReply() functions are
               identical. The program has violated the design principle DRY (don't repeat yourself). Combine
               them into ONE function. If you look through this program you will see several functions that
               work with both the computer's move and the human's move. The simple design of these unisex
               functions may guide you. Good luck.
                                                       * * *
What's next? Answer: THE MINIMAX ALGORITHM with ALPHA-BETA PRUNING. Read about this on the Internet and then
               modify the computer's strategy to go 3- or 4-ply deep. This will make the program tough for a
               human to beat. (We can't apply 3-4 ply thinking yet, because it would make the computer's move
               too slow.) And, of course, you could just wait for the lectures before you write this code.
